# We value privacy at Renoki Co.

This is our privacy policy. We'd like to let you know that your data is secure with us, and we'll get through each specific subject that may concern anyone about what we collect.

## GDPR

We're based on Europe and we took all the measures necessary to comply with the GDPR regulations:

- We store EU citizens' data in servers which are located in the EU, including, but not limited to: passwords, keys, personal informations (like names, emails, etc.), which are all encrypted at-rest and in-transit
- Users have their right to download or delete data at their own discretion.
- Users can opt-in and opt-out at any time for storing their data or share their anonymous usage for business or telemetry purposes.

## Accounts

The apps that require accounts are a bummer, but we use accounts to store your data. Either it's to keep your songs private or your owned servers intact, the account is the base structure for any of your private use.

To do so, you will need either a Social media account or E-Mail Address/Mobile Phone and a password.

For Social Media accounts, the app you're using to register with will display all the required access and you can either accept or decline the request. We will mainly store public data and sometimes the E-Mail address associated with that account, so you can further log in within our apps. Alongside the public data, for some special cases, we will request also some special permissions, like friends list or something of that ilk.

For E-Mail address/Mobile phone and password, well... It's obvious. We will use them only to login within the app, unless you give us permission to send to you marketing information. This mailing is described later on in this document.

If you decide to delete your account, you will be _poof_ erased whenever you want from your account settings.

## Mailing, Newsletters, Phone Numbers & SMS

Selling or distributing your emails or phone numbers is not what we do. The only notifications we can send are marketing newsletters (if you want; not mandatory) or in case there are some security issues with your account.

## Encryption

Keeping up with encryption and security is crucial. Making sure things stay safe is a must.

We store data at-rest (on disks) and in-transit (SSL/TLS), using services from last-to-date algorithms to services like AWS KMS with cryptographic performances.
