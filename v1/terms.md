We reserve to terminate all accounts or restrict IPs at our discretion, based on the following Do's and Dont's. Each action we take is well documented and will contain an unique case number, for the archival purposes.

## Do's

- You rights are your rights and we respect them, so you are free to do whatever you want without hurting others
- Create stuff, be creative, be unique
